# About
ParrotEnv is a TypeScript-based CLI tool that helps you set up a JavaScript/TypeScript or React project development environment. It automates the process of installing and configuring common dependencies such as editor configurations, linters, test tools and so on, allowing you to focus on coding rather than repeating the same configuration steps for each new project. With ParrotEnv, you can quickly scaffold your project with a standard and opinionated configuration that follows industry best practices. ParrotEnv is open-source and available under the MIT license with additional Copyright clauses, allowing you to use it freely in your projects while respecting the author's copyright.

# Installation
```bash
npm i parrotenv -g # recommended
```

# Usage
If you have installed ParrotEnv globally, you can use the command bellow to start the CLI:
```bash
parrotenv

# or the shortcut
pe
```

Or if you do want to install it locally with the `npm i parrotenv`, you can just use the npx commands after installing it on your project:
```bash
npx parrotenv

# or the shortcut
pe
```
